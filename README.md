### **Motivation**
I’ve always been curious about if budgets played a part in if a movie could be successful or not. So I decided to collect data on movies to see if it’s true. If not I can point out what makes movies that are successful have in common with one another.

### **Question**
Does a movie having a large budget guarantee it to become successful or is it possible for a small budget film to be just as successful as a big budget film?

### **Challenges**
The first challenge I had was finding datasets that I could use for my analysis. I found 3 different websites to help collect my data. With [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) I needed to unzip the datasets and connect them all together and pull the information I needed. I then had to find information on movie's production budgets and was able to find this information on [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/) website. I used [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/?ref_=bo_nb_yl_mojologo) to pull information on opening weekend earnings and number of theaters to movie was shown in. I needed to find a way to attach these datasets to each other and was able to merge them by movie title names and release year. After doing this I was still left with a few duplicate entries that I was able to filter out due to them having a low vote count for their reviews.
