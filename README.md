### **Motivation**
I have always loved going to the movie theater with my family growing up and enjoyed the time spent. I've always wondered  what it took to make a movie successful and how certain movies become successful.

### **Question**
Does a movie having a large budget guarantee it to become successful or is it possible for a small budget film to be just as successful as a big budget film.

### **Challenges**
The first challenge I had was finding datasets that I could use for my analysis. I found 3 different websites to help collect my data. With IMDb I needed to unzip the datasets from IMDb and connect them all together and pull the information I needed. I then had to find information on movie's production budgets and was able to find this information on [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/) website.
