### **Motivation**
I’ve always been curious about if budgets played a part in if a movie could be successful or not. So I decided to collect data on movies to see if it’s true. If not I can point out what makes movies that are successful have in common with one another.

### **Question**
Does a movie having a large budget guarantee it to become successful or is it possible for a small budget film to be just as successful as a big budget film?

### **Challenges**
The first challenge I had was finding datasets that I could use for my analysis. I found 3 different websites to help collect my data. With IMDb I needed to unzip the datasets from IMDb and connect them all together and pull the information I needed. I then had to find information on movie's production budgets and was able to find this information on [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/) website.
